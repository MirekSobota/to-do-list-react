              for creating beautiful and functional websites. I started my
              journey into programming some time ago, and ever since,{" "}
              <strong>
                I've been exploring the fascinating world of interactive web
                development.
              </strong>{" "}
              My experience and skills are continuously growing, and each
              project presents me with a new challenge that I tackle with
              enthusiasm and creativity. <br />
              Apart from programming, <strong>I am also a vegetarian.</strong>🥗
              I value healthy living and environmental protection. By choosing
              vegetarian food options,{" "}

                I strive to contribute to reducing our negative impact on the
                planet
